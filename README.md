# âœ¨ Whatâ€™s this about? 

Welcome to the Note App, a minimalist note-taking tool built purely with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. This app is your virtual notepad, designed to help you jot down thoughts, ideas, or tasks on the fly. Itâ€™s easy, simple, and does one thing really wellâ€”creating, deleting, and saving notes. Plus, all of your notes are stored locally right in your browser, so you can pick up where you left off, no matter what.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

Create Notes: Write anything and hit Enterâ€”your note will appear right where you need it.
Delete Notes: Clicking the little trash icon next to a note will send it packing. Clean and simple.
Persistence: Thanks to localStorage, your notes wonâ€™t disappear when you refresh the page (or close and reopen your browser). They stick around, just like a trusty sticky note.
